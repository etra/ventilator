## About project

This project is Discord bot. It's purpose is to handle requests sent to bot via Discord chat.
To initiate bot commands in discord you need to:
- mention bot @botname

For each mention or dm bot will respond by creating thread (private or public depending on where request was done dm or in channel). 
Using this thread bot will handle future communication by remembering the context of the conversation.
